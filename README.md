# DAA

Repo for Python-based implementations of some of the algorithms we studied in Design and Analysis of Algorithms (DAA) Course.
<br> This serves as a way to revise the concepts and also to analyze some algorithms (mainly sorting algorithms) using Matplotlib.
<br> For reference, the book we followed in the course is "Introduction to Algorithms" 3/4e by CLRS.
<br> <br>

Run using `python "path/to/file.py"`

For Graph Algorithms, use: `python -m "Graph Algorithms.<module name>.<py file>"`
  - e.g. `python -m "Graph Algorithms.Misc.topological_sorting"`
  - do not add `.py` in `<py file>`
<br> This is needed by Python in order to properly locate `Data_Structures` module and use its contents.
