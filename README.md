# DAA
Repo for Python-based implementations of some of the algorithms we studied in Design and Analysis of Algorithms (DAA) Course.
<br> This serves as a way to revise the concepts and also to analyze some algorithms (mainly sorting algorithms) using Matplotlib.
<br> For reference, the book we followed in the course is "Introduction to Algorithms" 3/4e by CLRS.
